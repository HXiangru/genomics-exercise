1. How many mutations are in the cancer genome?


2. What is the median size (in base pairs) of regions in the replication timing file?


3. List the top 5 earliest replicating region in the genome.


4. How many mutations are there in the 10,000 latest replicating regions?


5. Is the mutation rate generally higher in early or late replicating regions?


6. What type of DNA repair defect is this cancer likely to have based on the difference in mutation rate of the early and late replicating regions? (You will probably need to do literature search)


7. What cancer type do you think this sample is from?


8. Using GENCODE_known_canonical_TSS.bed, write a script to generate a file containing all genes with bidirectional promoters (i.e. non-overlapping promoters that are at most 1kb apart on opposing strands - see schematic below).
